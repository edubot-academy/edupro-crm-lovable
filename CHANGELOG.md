## [1.2.2] - 2026-03-28

### Changed
- CRM pages now show empty states instead of fabricated sample records when backend requests fail

- Call and meeting scheduling now happens inline in the current detail page instead of navigating to the Timeline page
- Scheduling actions on lead and contact detail pages were simplified into a single `Пландоо` action
